# obsidian-gear-mod

Obsidian Gear (or ObG for short) adds new items, blocks, liquids and dimensions to your game. The recipes for the items and blocks can be found at https://imgur.com/a/N62zrhI.
All the recipes that are not included there (eg Kyrite or Voidium) all work exactly like vanilla (ie the Kyrite Sword recipe is the same as a vanilla sword.)

Download at https://github.com/SniperNation/obsidian-gear-mod/releases. The installation/use instructions will be in the description of every release. 

## THIS MOD REQUIRES FORGE 1.16.5!!!

And don't judge me for using MCreator, OK?!
